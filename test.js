Ryan Dahl is the creator of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime system used to make server-side applications: 
Background
Dahl is an American software engineer born in 1981. He created Node.js in 2009, inspired by his criticism of Apache HTTP Server's limited ability to handle concurrent connections. 
Features
Node.js combines Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API. The initial release only supported Linux and Mac OS X, but a Windows version was implemented in 2011. 
Other work
Dahl is also the creator of Deno, a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime. He also introduced JSR, an alternative to NPM. 
Presentations
Dahl has spoken about the creation of Node.js, including: 
The importance of security in the JavaScript ecosystem 
The future of JavaScript 
Bridging the gap between server-side and browser JavaScript 
Protecting against malicious use 
The need for funding for open source projects
